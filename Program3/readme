   Program Description:
   Demonstrate the use of C++ program to call an external process
   and process the console output.  This program calls an installed
   older version of gawk to process code in "gawk.code" file using 
   input from "numbers.txt".  The result is printed to the screen
   and to a file.  
   
   This also demonstrates a simple use of Makefiles.  Here a simple
   Makefile can be used to quickly build, clean, and tar the project.
