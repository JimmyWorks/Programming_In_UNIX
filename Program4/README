	   Create an executable called via symlinks: scanner and parser to
	   execute scanning tokens or parsing an input postal addresses stream
	   to an XML output format.

Contents:

input/			input directory
  input.txt		  input source with postal addresses

output/			output directory
  parser_stderr.txt	  output from parser stderr containing XML output  
  parser_stdout.txt  	  output from parser stdout containing run messages
  scanner_output.txt 	  output from scanner stdout identifying input stream tokens

src/			source code directory
  tokens.l		  Lex file
  grammar.y		  Yacc file
  program4.c	  Main file
  Makefile		  Makefile
  program4		  Program executable
  parser		  symlink to program4
  scanner		  symlink to program4

  Other intermediate files in src:
  grammar.tab.c  tokens.c  grammar.tab.h
  

Makefile Commands:
  make                Make all executables.
  make clean          Clean all intermediate files, executables, and output files.
  make test           Make all and run unit test outputting everything to stdout.
  make delivery       Make all and run all.  Exports results to respective output files.
  make backup         Make a backup of the current project

Try this:

  To clean everything and regenerate output files:
  > make clean
  > make delivery

  To see the unit tests all output to stdout:
  > make test
